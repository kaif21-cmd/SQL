# Question1 
# Q1. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?
Filters rows before aggregation - where
Filters groups after aggregation - having

```jsx
Filter row before aggregation
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) as TotalQty
FROM Sales
WHERE Price > 2
GROUP BY Product;

```jsx
Filter row before aggregation
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) as TotalQty
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Product
HAVING SUM(Quantity) > 15;
```
# Question 2
## What is a Primary Key vs Foreign Key?
```jsx
- **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies each row (e.g., `customer_id`)
- **Foreign Key:** Links to another tableâ€™s primary key (e.g., `order.customer_id`)
```
# Question 3
## Difference Between UNION and UNION ALL

```jsx
- **UNION:** Removes duplicates
- **UNION ALL:** Keeps duplicates
```

# Question 4 
##  What is Normalization? Why is it Important?

```jsx
- Process of **breaking data into smaller, related tables** to avoid redundancy.
- Ensures **data integrity + easier updates.**
```

# question 5 
## Find the Second Highest Salary

```jsx
SELECT DISTINCT Salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

```


```jsx
# by using sub query
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees);

```
# by using dense rank()
```jsx
SELECT Salary
FROM (
    SELECT Salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM Employees
) AS RankedSalaries
WHERE rnk = 2;

```
